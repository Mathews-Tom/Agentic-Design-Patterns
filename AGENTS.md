# AGENTS

- Repo type: Markdown-only book. No code, build, tests, or linters are defined. Use plain Markdown editing.
- Package manager/executor: uv is available in this environment, but this repo has no Python project. Do not install or run anything.
- Build/lint/test:
  - Build: none
  - Lint: none (keep Markdown clean; wrap at ~100 chars)
  - Test: none; verify links and image paths manually
  - Single test command: not applicable
- File organization: content is under numbered folders; assets in `assets/`. Preserve filenames and relative links.
- Imports/includes: N/A; use standard Markdown links `[text](relative/path.md)` and images `![alt](assets/file.png)`.
- Formatting:
  - Use ATX headers (#, ##, ###). One H1 per file.
  - Leave a blank line around headers, lists, and images. Use fenced code blocks with language hints when needed.
  - Keep lines under ~100 chars; no trailing spaces; Unix newlines.
- Types: N/A; this is prose. Prefer concise, technical tone. Avoid emojis unless explicitly requested.
- Naming conventions: keep existing filename patterns; do not rename or re-number chapters. New files: follow existing `Section/Chapter_Title-<id>.md` style if truly necessary.
- Error handling: when changing links, verify targets exist. Do not commit broken links or missing assets. If unsure, add a short note and TODO.
- Cursor/Copilot rules: none found (`.cursor/rules/`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` absent). If added later, follow them.
- Git hygiene:
  - Commit small, focused changes with clear messages (why > what).
  - Do not commit large binary assets unless needed. Preserve MIT LICENSE.
- Accessibility: add meaningful alt text to images; avoid text-only color semantics.
- Review checklist before commit: links resolve, images render, headings hierarchy valid, no stray HTML, no merge conflict markers.
